/** @brief A billboard is tied to a specific point, but rotates to face the user.
    @details The billboard object represents a rectangle which is rooted at a specific point, but will rotate to face the user.  These are typically used in 3D, when the globe or map has a tilt.  They make little sense in 2D.
